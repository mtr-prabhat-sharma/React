2. Hooks gives to ability to split your components into smaller parts using custom hooks.


Ques: Rules of Hooks ?
Answer.
1. Hooks can only be used in function components.
2. Hooks must be called at the top level of your function components—meaning inside
the function, but not inside of a statement or inner function. Because hooks need to 
run just once every time your function component runs, they can’t be called from 
inside of conditional statements, loops, or nested functions.
