# REACT USE EFFECT HOOK

In React, the useEffect hook allows you to perform side effects in functional components. Side effects may include data fetching, subscriptions, or manually changing the DOM. The useEffect hook runs after every render and replaces lifecycle methods such as componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate, and componentWillUnmount in class components.
